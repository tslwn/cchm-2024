Determined the best model with EQS.
Psychometric route to explore intelligence.
Carroll's 1993 three-stratum model.
Correlations suggest the existence of a common higher-order factor of `general
intelligence', that subsumes broad ability factors.
Fluid/non-verbal intelligence and crystallized/verbal intelligence measures.
Analogous tasks to physics, biology, and chemistry.
Bespoke assessment.
Explained variance by g-factor (general intelligence): subsumed the variances of both
verbal measures but not fluid or non-verbal intelligence.
Cognitive abilities are important for causal thinking but couldn't explain the whole
picture.
Developmental differences in the g-factor.
